# Background

Since the United States government starting tracking the metric in January of 1948, we have never experienced a larger single month jump in the unemployment rate than the past month of April 2020. The 10.3% month-over-month increase brings the official unemployment level to 14.7%, a rate that we have not experienced since the peak of the Great Depression â€“ even worse, most academics theorize that the effective unemployment rate of those who have been furloughed and laid off exceeds 20%. In the past seven weeks, 33 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits.
These unprecedented economic hardships but one origin in the COVID-19 pandemic. With businesses shut down and people mandated to stay at home, economic activity has all but ground to a halt. Looking forward though, the most critical questions for our economic recovery remain unclear. How long will this recession last? How much worse will things get?
